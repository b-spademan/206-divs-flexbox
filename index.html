                 <p>I am an <span>Aspiring Web Developer</span> with a background in Event Management who is on a new journey learning to code. I strive to build user friendly, responsive websites with beautidul designs and layouts. When I am not learning to code, I love to get out and enjoy nature, hit the slopes on my snowboard and enjoy a refreshing beer with good friends.</p>

            <div class="div-1">
                <p>I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. After finishing university I followed my heart to the mountains where what was supposed to be 6 months working at the Lake Louise Ski Resort, turned into five years! I may be a big city girl, but the small mountain towns is where my heart is.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>I LOVE the outdoors. Whether it be hiking, taking it easy on the beach or shredding the mountain. I love adventure and discovering the beauty of the natural world. I am happiest when surrounded by nature.</p>

            <div class="div-3">
                <p>Fun Fact: At the age of 5 I started taking cello lessons, and in highschool went to an Arts school! Although I am classically trained, in university I had a go at playing cover songs at the local pub on open mic nights with a friend. That was fun!</p>
